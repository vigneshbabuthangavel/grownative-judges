**Q: How is this different from Duolingo?**  
A: Duolingo is second-language drills. GrowNative is **foundational literacy**: read complete ideas, reason, and write in the native language.

**Q: How do you keep it safe for kids?**  
A: Global child-safety + topic and level constraints + ethics rubric + review gate. If a check fails, it regenerates with explicit fixes.

A: Each page is a multimodal learning unit: illustration + text + target words + meanings. Images reinforce comprehension, not decoration.

A: Recommend OS IME (native keyboard). Optional phonetic helper converts Latin input to native script for writing practice.

**Q: What about privacy?**
